# Introduction

This project explores and analyzes a dataset from the World Health Organization and the World Bank, which contains data of the GDP and life expectancy of 6 countries across 16 years.

Broadly, the project seeks to find if there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy. Other questions and associated observations are contained in the [Jupyter notebook](./life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb).

Colorblind-friendly colors are used in the plots to ensure that the data is accessible to all.
